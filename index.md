### CPSC 120

Lab 1 

Lab 1 was enjoyable for me because it was my first experience with code. It enabled me to get over the minor complexities and comprehend the fundamentals. I had confidence that I could complete this code even when it seemed like it was getting difficult and I wanted to give up since I could use the repository and see the words "hello" appear on the screen when the program was ready to execute.


Lab 7

Regardless of the purpose, my family and I love playing card games, thus I really loved the second portion of this lab. It was a lot of fun to figure out the math and arrange the cards to have a specific value.


Lab 3:
 I like the first portion of this lab because I love solving math problems and creating equations. It was enjoyable to be able to determine celebrities' basal metabolic rates, or BMRs. establishing the computation to determine the solutions. My skills were put to the test by people of all ages, weights, heights, and genders.
